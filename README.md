# TwitterBot v1.0
My first Python project

Basically a command line program uses tweepy library to for twitter API and extracting informations
Giving away the tokens and consumer secret is not cool so you can generate your own from apps.twitter.com
and explore it as using your own Twitter account.

NOTE: Run main.py to run the program
